	Detecting the real-time emotion of the person with a camera input is one of the advanced features in the machine learning process. The detection of emotion of a person using a camera is easiest and best way to do this  The detection of emotion is made done by the machine learning . we used the trained dataset to detect the emotion of the person. For detecting the different emotions, first we needed to train the algorithm those different emotions
